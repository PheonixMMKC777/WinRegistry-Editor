         Windows Registry Editor

This is a program to edit the Windows Registry for Windows 10
In theory it would work with Windows 7/8 but dont expect 100% compatibility.


Most commands wont work if it isnt running on elevated privledges (Admin)

If for some reason it doesnt start upon clicking...
1. Run powershell as Administrator
2. Type this command	cd C:\Users\YOURPROFILENAME\Downloads\WinRegistry-Editor-main\WinRegistry-Editor-main\
3. Type this command	Start Win10RegistryEditor.ps1
If you moved the program out of the downloads folder, the path will be different
